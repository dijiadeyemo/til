# Functional Programming

**Author** : Diji

## Notes

Functional programming is a function based paradigm of programing. It is suited for some operations like services, algorightms and testing

### Concepts

#### Immutability

Object do not change state

#### First Class functions

Functions can be passed around like variables with no restrictions (Higher Order functions)

#### Higher order functions

These are functions that return other functions e.g `const add = a => (b => a + b)`

#### Currying

Currying is when to break a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that take part of the argument

#### Pure Functions

* Stateless
* No side effect
* For every x, f(x) will always be the same

Pure functions can be eaily optimised

#### Memozation

Caching of pure functions to improve performace

#### testing

No setup and tear down is usually needed for testing functional code
